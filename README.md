# weightedTeamGenerator
      lil side project for progressive internship.
      uses a greedy algorithm with K Means sensibilities
      taking a list of names and weights, generates teams w as-close-to-equal-as-possible weights.
Originally was going to fully apply K means to this, but ended up going a different direction. <br />
My buddy Nikhil, [@nkchakra](https://github.com/nkchakra), wrote a couple K means programs in this repository that are 
worth checking out.
